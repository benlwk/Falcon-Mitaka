    WRN   Threads are executed in groups of 32 threads called warps. This kernel launch is configured to execute 25     
          threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are       
          unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256      
          threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one      
          large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance.  This is particularly beneficial to     
          kernels that frequently call __syncthreads(). See the Hardware Model

    WRN   This kernel's theoretical occupancy (33.3%) is limited by the number of blocks that can fit on the SM The     
          difference between calculated theoretical (33.3%) and measured achieved occupancy (20.9%) can be the result   
          of warp scheduling overheads or workload imbalances during the kernel execution. Load imbalances can occur    
          between warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices Guide   
          (https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-best-practices-guide/index.html#occupancy) for more details on

    WRN   Threads are executed in groups of 32 threads called warps. This kernel launch is configured to execute 25     
          threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are       
          unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256      
          threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one      
          large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance.  This is particularly beneficial to     
          kernels that frequently call __syncthreads(). See the Hardware Model

    WRN   This kernel's theoretical occupancy is not impacted by any block limit. The difference between calculated     
          theoretical (100.0%) and measured achieved occupancy (86.3%) can be the result of warp scheduling overheads   
          or workload imbalances during the kernel execution. Load imbalances can occur between warps within a block    
          as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices Guide

    WRN   A wave of thread blocks is defined as the maximum number of blocks that can be executed in parallel on the    
          target GPU. The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical       
          occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 2 full waves and a partial wave of 208 thread blocks.  
          Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, the partial wave may account for   
          up to 33.3% of the total kernel runtime with a lower occupancy of 25.8%. Try launching a grid with no         
          partial wave. The overall impact of this tail effect also lessens with the number of full waves executed for  
          a grid. See the Hardware Model

    INF   The kernel is utilizing greater than 80.0% of the available compute or memory performance of the device. To   
          further improve performance, work will likely need to be shifted from the most utilized to another unit.      
          Start by analyzing DRAM in the Memory Workload Analysis section.

    WRN   A wave of thread blocks is defined as the maximum number of blocks that can be executed in parallel on the    
          target GPU. The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical       
          occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 2 full waves and a partial wave of 208 thread blocks.  
          Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, the partial wave may account for   
          up to 33.3% of the total kernel runtime with a lower occupancy of 26.5%. Try launching a grid with no         
          partial wave. The overall impact of this tail effect also lessens with the number of full waves executed for  
          a grid. See the Hardware Model

    WRN   This kernel's theoretical occupancy is not impacted by any block limit. The difference between calculated     
          theoretical (100.0%) and measured achieved occupancy (73.5%) can be the result of warp scheduling overheads   
          or workload imbalances during the kernel execution. Load imbalances can occur between warps within a block    
          as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices Guide

    WRN   Memory is more heavily utilized than Compute: Look at the Memory Workload Analysis section to identify the    
          DRAM bottleneck. Check memory replay (coalescing) metrics to make sure you're efficiently utilizing the       
          bytes transferred. Also consider whether it is possible to do more work per memory access (kernel fusion) or  
          whether there are values you can (re)compute.

    WRN   A wave of thread blocks is defined as the maximum number of blocks that can be executed in parallel on the    
          target GPU. The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical       
          occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 1 full waves and a partial wave of 208 thread blocks.  
          Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, the partial wave may account for   
          up to 50.0% of the total kernel runtime with a lower occupancy of 26.1%. Try launching a grid with no         
          partial wave. The overall impact of this tail effect also lessens with the number of full waves executed for  
          a grid. See the Hardware Model

    WRN   This kernel's theoretical occupancy is not impacted by any block limit. The difference between calculated     
          theoretical (100.0%) and measured achieved occupancy (73.9%) can be the result of warp scheduling overheads   
          or workload imbalances during the kernel execution. Load imbalances can occur between warps within a block    
          as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices Guide

    WRN   A wave of thread blocks is defined as the maximum number of blocks that can be executed in parallel on the    
          target GPU. The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical       
          occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 2 full waves and a partial wave of 208 thread blocks.  
          Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, the partial wave may account for   
          up to 33.3% of the total kernel runtime with a lower occupancy of 26.8%. Try launching a grid with no         
          partial wave. The overall impact of this tail effect also lessens with the number of full waves executed for  
          a grid. See the Hardware Model

    WRN   This kernel's theoretical occupancy is not impacted by any block limit. The difference between calculated     
          theoretical (100.0%) and measured achieved occupancy (73.2%) can be the result of warp scheduling overheads   
          or workload imbalances during the kernel execution. Load imbalances can occur between warps within a block    
          as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices Guide

    WRN   This kernel's theoretical occupancy is not impacted by any block limit. The difference between calculated     
          theoretical (100.0%) and measured achieved occupancy (70.5%) can be the result of warp scheduling overheads   
          or workload imbalances during the kernel execution. Load imbalances can occur between warps within a block    
          as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices Guide

    WRN   A wave of thread blocks is defined as the maximum number of blocks that can be executed in parallel on the    
          target GPU. The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical       
          occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 1 full waves and a partial wave of 208 thread blocks.  
          Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, the partial wave may account for   
          up to 50.0% of the total kernel runtime with a lower occupancy of 26.0%. Try launching a grid with no         
          partial wave. The overall impact of this tail effect also lessens with the number of full waves executed for  
          a grid. See the Hardware Model

    WRN   This kernel's theoretical occupancy is not impacted by any block limit. The difference between calculated     
          theoretical (100.0%) and measured achieved occupancy (74.0%) can be the result of warp scheduling overheads   
          or workload imbalances during the kernel execution. Load imbalances can occur between warps within a block    
          as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices Guide

    WRN   A wave of thread blocks is defined as the maximum number of blocks that can be executed in parallel on the    
          target GPU. The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical       
          occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 1 full waves and a partial wave of 208 thread blocks.  
          Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, the partial wave may account for   
          up to 50.0% of the total kernel runtime with a lower occupancy of 25.7%. Try launching a grid with no         
          partial wave. The overall impact of this tail effect also lessens with the number of full waves executed for

    WRN   This kernel's theoretical occupancy is not impacted by any block limit. The difference between calculated     
          theoretical (100.0%) and measured achieved occupancy (74.3%) can be the result of warp scheduling overheads   
          or workload imbalances during the kernel execution. Load imbalances can occur between warps within a block    
          as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices Guide

    WRN   A wave of thread blocks is defined as the maximum number of blocks that can be executed in parallel on the    
          target GPU. The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical       
          occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 2 full waves and a partial wave of 208 thread blocks.  
          Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, the partial wave may account for   
          up to 33.3% of the total kernel runtime with a lower occupancy of 26.5%. Try launching a grid with no         
          partial wave. The overall impact of this tail effect also lessens with the number of full waves executed for

    WRN   Memory is more heavily utilized than Compute: Look at the Memory Workload Analysis section to identify the    
          DRAM bottleneck. Check memory replay (coalescing) metrics to make sure you're efficiently utilizing the       
          bytes transferred. Also consider whether it is possible to do more work per memory access (kernel fusion) or  
          whether there are values you can (re)compute.

    WRN   This kernel's theoretical occupancy is not impacted by any block limit. The difference between calculated     
          theoretical (100.0%) and measured achieved occupancy (71.0%) can be the result of warp scheduling overheads   
          or workload imbalances during the kernel execution. Load imbalances can occur between warps within a block    
          as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices Guide

    WRN   Memory is more heavily utilized than Compute: Look at the Memory Workload Analysis section to identify the    
          DRAM bottleneck. Check memory replay (coalescing) metrics to make sure you're efficiently utilizing the       
          bytes transferred. Also consider whether it is possible to do more work per memory access (kernel fusion) or  
          whether there are values you can (re)compute.

    WRN   A wave of thread blocks is defined as the maximum number of blocks that can be executed in parallel on the    
          target GPU. The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical

    WRN   This kernel's theoretical occupancy is not impacted by any block limit. The difference between calculated     
          theoretical (100.0%) and measured achieved occupancy (72.8%) can be the result of warp scheduling overheads   
          or workload imbalances during the kernel execution. Load imbalances can occur between warps within a block    
          as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices Guide

    WRN   Memory is more heavily utilized than Compute: Look at the Memory Workload Analysis section to identify the    
          DRAM bottleneck. Check memory replay (coalescing) metrics to make sure you're efficiently utilizing the       
          bytes transferred. Also consider whether it is possible to do more work per memory access (kernel fusion) or  
          whether there are values you can (re)compute.

    WRN   A wave of thread blocks is defined as the maximum number of blocks that can be executed in parallel on the    
          target GPU. The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical       
          occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 1 full waves and a partial wave of 208 thread blocks.  
          Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, the partial wave may account for   
          up to 50.0% of the total kernel runtime with a lower occupancy of 25.9%. Try launching a grid with no         
          partial wave. The overall impact of this tail effect also lessens with the number of full waves executed for  
          a grid. See the Hardware Model

    WRN   This kernel's theoretical occupancy is not impacted by any block limit. The difference between calculated     
          theoretical (100.0%) and measured achieved occupancy (74.1%) can be the result of warp scheduling overheads   
          or workload imbalances during the kernel execution. Load imbalances can occur between warps within a block    
          as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices Guide

    WRN   Compute is more heavily utilized than Memory: Look at the Compute Workload Analysis section to see what the   
          compute pipelines are spending their time doing. Also, consider whether any computation is redundant and      
          could be reduced or moved to look-up tables.

    WRN   A wave of thread blocks is defined as the maximum number of blocks that can be executed in parallel on the    
          target GPU. The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical       
          occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 1 full waves and a partial wave of 208 thread blocks.  
          Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, the partial wave may account for   
          up to 50.0% of the total kernel runtime with a lower occupancy of 26.5%. Try launching a grid with no         
          partial wave. The overall impact of this tail effect also lessens with the number of full waves executed for  
          a grid. See the Hardware Model

    WRN   This kernel's theoretical occupancy is not impacted by any block limit. The difference between calculated     
          theoretical (100.0%) and measured achieved occupancy (73.5%) can be the result of warp scheduling overheads   
          or workload imbalances during the kernel execution. Load imbalances can occur between warps within a block    
          as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices Guide

    WRN   A wave of thread blocks is defined as the maximum number of blocks that can be executed in parallel on the    
          target GPU. The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical       
          occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 2 full waves and a partial wave of 208 thread blocks.  
          Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, the partial wave may account for   
          up to 33.3% of the total kernel runtime with a lower occupancy of 25.7%. Try launching a grid with no         
          partial wave. The overall impact of this tail effect also lessens with the number of full waves executed for  
          a grid. See the Hardware Model

    WRN   This kernel's theoretical occupancy is not impacted by any block limit. The difference between calculated     
          theoretical (100.0%) and measured achieved occupancy (74.3%) can be the result of warp scheduling overheads   
          or workload imbalances during the kernel execution. Load imbalances can occur between warps within a block    
          as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices Guide

    WRN   A wave of thread blocks is defined as the maximum number of blocks that can be executed in parallel on the    
          target GPU. The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical       
          occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 2 full waves and a partial wave of 208 thread blocks.  
          Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, the partial wave may account for   
          up to 33.3% of the total kernel runtime with a lower occupancy of 26.4%. Try launching a grid with no         
          partial wave. The overall impact of this tail effect also lessens with the number of full waves executed for  
          a grid. See the Hardware Model

    WRN   This kernel's theoretical occupancy is not impacted by any block limit. The difference between calculated     
          theoretical (100.0%) and measured achieved occupancy (73.6%) can be the result of warp scheduling overheads   
          or workload imbalances during the kernel execution. Load imbalances can occur between warps within a block    
          as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices Guide

    WRN   This kernel's theoretical occupancy is not impacted by any block limit. The difference between calculated     
          theoretical (100.0%) and measured achieved occupancy (73.9%) can be the result of warp scheduling overheads   
          or workload imbalances during the kernel execution. Load imbalances can occur between warps within a block

    WRN   A wave of thread blocks is defined as the maximum number of blocks that can be executed in parallel on the    
          target GPU. The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical       
          occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 1 full waves and a partial wave of 208 thread blocks.  
          Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, the partial wave may account for   
          up to 50.0% of the total kernel runtime with a lower occupancy of 26.1%. Try launching a grid with no         
          partial wave. The overall impact of this tail effect also lessens with the number of full waves executed for  
          a grid. See the Hardware Model

    WRN   This kernel's theoretical occupancy is not impacted by any block limit. The difference between calculated     
          theoretical (100.0%) and measured achieved occupancy (76.2%) can be the result of warp scheduling overheads   
          or workload imbalances during the kernel execution. Load imbalances can occur between warps within a block    
          as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices Guide

    WRN   This kernel's theoretical occupancy is not impacted by any block limit. The difference between calculated     
          theoretical (100.0%) and measured achieved occupancy (70.2%) can be the result of warp scheduling overheads   
          or workload imbalances during the kernel execution. Load imbalances can occur between warps within a block    
          as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices Guide

    INF   The kernel is utilizing greater than 80.0% of the available compute or memory performance of the device. To   
          further improve performance, work will likely need to be shifted from the most utilized to another unit.

    WRN   Threads are executed in groups of 32 threads called warps. This kernel launch is configured to execute 1      
          threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are       
          unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256      
          threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one      
          large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance.  This is particularly beneficial to     
          kernels that frequently call __syncthreads(). See the Hardware Model

    WRN   Threads are executed in groups of 32 threads called warps. This kernel launch is configured to execute 25     
          threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are       
          unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256      
          threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one      
          large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance.  This is particularly beneficial to     
          kernels that frequently call __syncthreads(). See the Hardware Model

    WRN   This kernel's theoretical occupancy (33.3%) is limited by the number of blocks that can fit on the SM The     
          difference between calculated theoretical (33.3%) and measured achieved occupancy (21.8%) can be the result   
          of warp scheduling overheads or workload imbalances during the kernel execution. Load imbalances can occur    
          between warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices Guide   
          (https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-best-practices-guide/index.html#occupancy) for more details on

    WRN   Memory is more heavily utilized than Compute: Look at the Memory Workload Analysis section to identify the    
          DRAM bottleneck. Check memory replay (coalescing) metrics to make sure you're efficiently utilizing the       
          bytes transferred. Also consider whether it is possible to do more work per memory access (kernel fusion) or  
          whether there are values you can (re)compute.

    WRN   This kernel's theoretical occupancy is not impacted by any block limit. The difference between calculated     
          theoretical (100.0%) and measured achieved occupancy (71.9%) can be the result of warp scheduling overheads   
          or workload imbalances during the kernel execution. Load imbalances can occur between warps within a block    
          as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices Guide

    WRN   A wave of thread blocks is defined as the maximum number of blocks that can be executed in parallel on the    
          target GPU. The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical       
          occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 1 full waves and a partial wave of 208 thread blocks.  
          Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, the partial wave may account for   
          up to 50.0% of the total kernel runtime with a lower occupancy of 26.4%. Try launching a grid with no         
          partial wave. The overall impact of this tail effect also lessens with the number of full waves executed for  
          a grid. See the Hardware Model

    WRN   A wave of thread blocks is defined as the maximum number of blocks that can be executed in parallel on the    
          target GPU. The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical       
          occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 2 full waves and a partial wave of 208 thread blocks.  
          Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, the partial wave may account for   
          up to 33.3% of the total kernel runtime with a lower occupancy of 25.5%. Try launching a grid with no         
          partial wave. The overall impact of this tail effect also lessens with the number of full waves executed for  
          a grid. See the Hardware Model

          theoretical (100.0%) and measured achieved occupancy (74.5%) can be the result of warp scheduling overheads

    WRN   This kernel's theoretical occupancy is not impacted by any block limit. The difference between calculated     
          theoretical (100.0%) and measured achieved occupancy (78.2%) can be the result of warp scheduling overheads   
          or workload imbalances during the kernel execution. Load imbalances can occur between warps within a block    
          as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices Guide

    WRN   Threads are executed in groups of 32 threads called warps. This kernel launch is configured to execute 1      
          threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are       
          unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256      
          threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one      
          large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance.  This is particularly beneficial to     
          kernels that frequently call __syncthreads(). See the Hardware Model
